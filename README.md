# tp3.2_CMS
Written in the TP3.2 framework, login, background, etc. are all right, just write the front desk.

The CMS system written with the TP3.2 framework has the advantages of speeding up project development,
verifying the code base, uploading the file library, etc., facilitating secondary development, 
login, background, etc. 
As long as the front desk is written, 
the data is called.

用TP3.2框架写的CMS系统，
好处加快项目开发，
验证码库、上传文件库等都有了，方便二次开发，
登录、后台等都好了  只要写前台就行 调用数据
